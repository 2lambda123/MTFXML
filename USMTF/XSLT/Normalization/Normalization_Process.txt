This document describes the process by which MTF XML Schema simpleTypes are normalized and streamlined for practical use.

1. Overriding Principle: The creation of a "Type" for every field in MTF simply by adding "Type" or "SimpleType" to each field name does not leverage the concept of Typing correctly.  Many fields have identical content restrictions.  By comparing regular expressions, numerical content, and enumerations the number of simpleTypes are significantly reduced and the XML implementation of the MIL STDs employs reuse, extension and restriction effectively.

1. Single Enumerations.
    a. Rationale: The use of a simple type with a restriction and a single enumeration is a result of vapid adherence to a "best practice" which advises avoidance of fixed and default values.  Creation of "Types" for elements which will only ever contain one value and will never be extended or restricted is pointless.  
    b. Solution: The SingleEnums.xsl converts simpleTypes with single enumerations to elements with fixed values so that they can be directly referenced from complexTypes as global elements from fields.xsd.
    
2.  Common Enumerations.
    a. Rationale: Elements with identical Enumerations can be typed using a common simpleType definition.    
    b. Solution: The SingleEnums.xsl converts simpleTypes with single enumerations to elements with fixed values so that they can be directly referenced from complexTypes as global elements from fields.xsd.
